# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-10)

**Core value:** The end-to-end flow (generator → ingest → Kafka → detector → ClickHouse/PostgreSQL → API → live dashboard) works and is provably correct under failure, with deterministic, deduplicated alerts and no loss of acknowledged events.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundations & Contracts

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundations & Contracts)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-10 - Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Roadmap follows spec §14 order, 6 phases. Optional Phase 7 (Aegis, ML) deferred to v2.
- DEP-03 (hardened CI) assigned to Phase 6. Phase 1 CI skeleton covered by FND-02/FND-05.
- UI-05 (System page) placed in Phase 5 because it needs lag and health metrics from OBS-02.
- GEN-01/GEN-03 in Phase 2, GEN-02 in Phase 3, OBS-01 in Phase 2.
- SSE fan-out via Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY with `seq` backfill. Postgres is the alert list index (ADRs in Phase 3/4).
- Epoch-aligned tumbling windows with state-pin replay recovery (ADR first in Phase 3).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: confirm layout (`backend/cmd/*`) and boilerplate removal in discuss. Go 1.26 bump required by franz-go.
- Open gaps: tumbling-window straddle acceptability, rule-version semantics under replay, event_id policy, dashboard login flow.
